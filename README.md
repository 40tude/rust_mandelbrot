## About
* Read/translate this [**article on 40tude.fr**](https://www.40tude.fr/docs/06_programmation/rust/003_mandelbrot_multithread/mandelbrot_multithread.html) to get much more details
* I start learning Rust in Q1 2025
* some of my very first experiments
* I compare single-threaded vs multithreaded Mandelbrot set drawings
    * png files are saved in ./assets
    * I take the time to get single-threaded version working as I want
    * main_07 is where I start to compare single-threaded vs multithreaded
* read the comments in the different versions of main : main_00, main_01...
* at the top of the files, I explain the changes between this version and the previous one
* in the code I don't keep comments from the previous versions, I add new comments
* to underline the difference in the code, I comment the lines from the previous version when this makes sense 
* when you want to run main_xx, rename it main.rs
